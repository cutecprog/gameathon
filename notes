Conway's game of life on a finite rolling square plane. A text file represents
current generation as a character matrix the size of the game's plane. Player
is a live cell that may move to contiguous dead cells in one generation. Moving
into a contiuous live cell takes zero generations and increases players hp by
one. When player moves off this cell it is dead. Player can lose one hp so that
when they move off the cell will remain alive: this entire action takes zero
generations. If current player cell is becomes alive then player loses one hp
then player can move taking the normal one generation and leaving the cell
dead. Alteratively the player can place a cell losing one additional hp and
leaving the structure uneffected and taking zero generations.
